Secure and seamless authentication.

== Description ==
In response to the increasing number of online frauds and account hacks and the need to safeguard customers’ personal data, we have created an eID-based authentication plugin solution for WordPress and its eCommerce plugin WooCommerce. 

This solution is designed to meet the growing demands for enhanced security in the world's most widely used content management platform.

Nestech Wordpress Authentication Plugin has been created in cooperation with Dokobit, a leading trust service provider in the Baltics and Iceland.

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin from Wordpress plugins registry
2. Add an application password for your admin user in Wordpress: navigate to Users - open your admin user, scroll down to the bottom and create a new application password. Copy this value.
3. Open Nestech Dokobit menu item - subscribe to one of the plans
4. In the settings tab - add your admin username, and the application password you generated in step 2.
5. Open your Wordpress page\'s login form - and you will see the Login options on top of the regular login form.
